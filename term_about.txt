I'm currently working on scalable inference at Anthropic. Previously, I was at Applied Intuition where I focused on building and scaling our data infrastructure, particularly working with Apache Spark and Apache Hudi. Before that, I worked on search infrastructure at Uber.

I graduated from Georgia Tech in 2021, where I had the privilege of researching under Dr. Judy Hoffman, focusing on computer vision and transfer learning across CV tasks.

I'm always excited to connect with people who share similar interests. Feel free to reach out!
