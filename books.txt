Title: Designing Data-Intensive Applications
Author: Martin Kleppmann
Review: A comprehensive guide for every software engineer touching data, Kleppmann makes complex topics easily understandable and engaging. Remarkably relevant since its 2017 publication.

Title: Building Microservices
Author: Sam Newman

Title: Learning GraphQL
Author: Eve Porcello and Alex Banks
Review: A clear and well-structured introduction to GraphQL. Great for foundational knowledge, but may not cover all aspects of bespoke implementations.

Title: High Performance Spark
Author: Holden Karau, Rachel Warren, Anya Bida
Review: A go-to resource for leveraging Spark, useful for optimizing and understanding Spark jobs. Not as helpful for initial setup or tuning of a Spark cluster.

Title: Designing Event-Driven Systems
Author: Ben Stopford
Review: A great introduction to the concepts of event-driven architecture, offering a solid foundation for those new to the topic. The book potentially offers Kafka as nearly universal tool. I personally struggle to evaluate the merit behind its argument.

Title: A Philosophy of Software Design, 2nd Edition
Author: John Ousterhout
Review: An excellent read for junior developers, offering valuable insights on writing clear, maintainable interfaces. The first half is particularly strong. The latter half tends to heavily cite earlier chapters without adding much depth.
